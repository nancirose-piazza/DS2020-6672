This is the code written in a pynb for training a deep neural network for binary Malware Classification. 
The dataset used is EMBER 2017 version 2. EMBER stands for Endgame Malware Benchmark for Research which is a large dataset composed
of labeled and unlabeled samples of extracted vectorized features from Portable Executable Header files through project LIEF.

More information about them can be found on their GitHub:

The midterm is composed of three tasks: Making a deep neural network, deploying it to the cloud via Amazon SagaMaker, and creating a script
for say a client to use to determine a single PE file (under 2MB) is malicious or benign. In this repository, putty.exe is used as the
sample.

Task 1: Completed.
Task 2: Cannot be completed due to account permission on AWS
Task 3: Completed.
